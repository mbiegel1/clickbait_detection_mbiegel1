# CLickbait Detection
### Detecting Clickbait among news sites and YouTube videos using supervised machine learning
#### CMCS 478 Project

A Jupyter Notebook for the program exists; the setup and program are contained within this file. If you cannot access the Jupyter Notebook, there are python files that pertain to each part of the application:
<br>`data_detect_clickbait.py`: Model training and testing on external data
<br>`user_detect_clickbait.py`: User-inputtable clickbait titles for clickbait classification

If using the python files and not the Jupyter Notebook, install the necessary packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Run the python files with `python3`.
